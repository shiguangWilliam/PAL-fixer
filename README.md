# PAL-fixer
This is a simple Python script used to convert Westwood PAL files to Microsoft PAL files, or vice versa.

How to use:
1. Fill in the `inputPath` and `outputPath` with the file you want to transform and the location where you want to save the result, respectively.
2. Set the `reverse` factor in `GenPSPal`. If `reverse` is False, it means transform Westwood PAL files into Microsoft PAL files. If `reverse` is True, it means transform Microsoft PAL files into Westwood PAL files.
